# Lab 8

Activities:

1. Share with your group: *what is the trickiest bug you ever had to troubleshoot in your code?*

2. Debugging Practice: inside your `f22` repo, there is a `labs/debug/6-flask/main.py` and accompanying `index.html` file.  Try running it, then fix the bugs.  These are bugs we often see in P4, so this will help you avoid (or fix) bugs as you're working on the project.

4. More Debugging Practice: inside your `f22` repo, there is a `labs/debug/7-nested-except/divide.py`.  Try running it from the terminal, then fix the bugs.

4. Consider working on the group portion of P4 with your group during the remaining lab time

5. remember that each study group member should fill the TopHat question: https://app.tophat.com/e/594996
